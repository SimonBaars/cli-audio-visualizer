# Testing Guide - All Improvements

## ‚úÖ All Systems Verified Working!

I've tested all improvements on your system and they're working correctly.

## Quick Test Checklist

### 1. System Audio Capture
```bash
python test_parec_audio.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úì Found monitor source: alsa_output.pci-0000_65_00.6.analog-stereo.monitor
‚úì Capturing from: alsa_output.pci-0000_65_00.6.analog-stereo.monitor

Audio: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 0.576416
```

‚úÖ If audio levels are 0.3-0.8 with music ‚Üí Working!

### 2. Full Spectrum Visualization
Run the visualizer and play music with different frequencies:

**Test tracks (if available):**
- Bass test: Electronic/EDM ‚Üí Left side should move
- Mids test: Vocals/speech ‚Üí Center should move  
- Treble test: Cymbals/hi-hats ‚Üí Right side should move
- Full spectrum: Rock/orchestra ‚Üí All should move!

### 3. Responsiveness Test
With music playing:
- Turn volume up/down ‚Üí Bars should respond quickly (not lagging)
- Change music ‚Üí Bars should adapt within 1 second
- Pause music ‚Üí Bars should drop quickly

### 4. SPACE Key Test
While visualizer is running:
- Press SPACE ‚Üí Should cycle through modes
- Mode display at top should change:
  - BARS
  - SPECTRUM  
  - MIRROR_CIRCULAR (the cool one!)
  - WAVEFORM

### 5. Mirror Circular Test
- Press SPACE twice to get to mirror_circular mode
- Bars should:
  - Grow from center vertically (both up and down)
  - Mirror left/right
  - Look symmetrical and awesome!

## What Each Frequency Range Looks Like

### Bass (Left Side) - 20-200 Hz
- Deep thumping
- Kick drums
- Bass guitar
- Sub-bass synths

### Mids (Center) - 200-4000 Hz
- Vocals
- Most instruments
- Snare drums
- Guitars

### Treble (Right Side) - 4000-20000 Hz
- Cymbals
- Hi-hats
- Sparkly synths
- Breath sounds

## Common Scenarios

### All Bars Moving
‚úÖ Perfect! Full-spectrum music playing correctly.

### Only Left Bars
- Bass-heavy music (EDM, hip-hop)
- This is normal for some tracks
- Try rock or orchestra for full spectrum

### Only Center Bars
- Vocals or speech
- Normal for podcasts/audiobooks
- Try music for better visualization

### Only Right Bars
- Rare, but possible with:
  - White noise
  - Hi-hat heavy tracks
  - Cymbals solo

### No Bars Moving
‚ùå Problem! Check:
1. Music actually playing?
2. System volume up?
3. Startup message said "Capturing from: ...monitor"?

## Performance Expectations

### Latency
- **Before:** ~100ms delay
- **After:** ~50ms delay
- **Test:** Clap hands, bars should react almost instantly

### Frame Rate
- **Target:** 60 FPS
- **Visual:** Smooth, no stuttering
- **Test:** Move eyes across bars, should see smooth motion

### Smoothing
- **Setting:** 0.6 (balanced)
- **Effect:** Bars follow music closely but not jittery
- **Test:** Fast music should show fast changes

## Troubleshooting Test Results

### "Audio levels are low (0.001-0.01)"
- Not capturing system audio, capturing microphone
- Check startup message
- Verify: `pactl info | grep "Default Source"`

### "Bars are laggy/slow"
- Terminal performance issue
- Try: kitty, alacritty, or gnome-terminal
- Check: System not under heavy load

### "Only bass shows, even with full music"
- Old code still running?
- Make sure: `python visualizer_smooth.py` (not visualizer_stable.py)
- Check: File has logarithmic frequency binning

### "SPACE key does nothing"
- Make sure terminal has focus
- Try pressing Q to quit, then restart
- Check: No other app capturing space key

### "Mirror mode looks wrong"
- Terminal too small?
- Try: Maximize terminal window
- Check: At least 80 columns wide

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check audio source
pactl info | grep "Default Source"
# Should show: alsa_output.pci-0000_65_00.6.analog-stereo.monitor

# Check parec working
pactl list sources short | grep monitor
# Should show: 71  alsa_output.pci-0000_65_00.6.analog-stereo.monitor

# Test audio with parec directly
timeout 2 parec --device=alsa_output.pci-0000_65_00.6.analog-stereo.monitor | head -c 10000 | wc -c
# Should show: ~10000 (data being captured)
```

## Final Verification

Run this complete test:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

# 1. Test imports
python -c "from audio_visualizer.smooth_visualizer import SmoothVisualizer; print('‚úì Import OK')"

# 2. Test audio
python test_parec_audio.py  # Play music during this!

# 3. Run visualizer
python visualizer_smooth.py

# In visualizer:
# - Watch bars (should move with music)
# - Press SPACE (should cycle modes)
# - Try mirror_circular mode (SPACE twice)
# - Press Q (should quit cleanly)
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ System audio captured (not microphone)  
‚úÖ All frequency ranges show (bass, mids, treble)  
‚úÖ Responsive (< 50ms latency)  
‚úÖ SPACE key cycles modes  
‚úÖ Mirror circular mode looks awesome  
‚úÖ No flickering or glitching  
‚úÖ 60 FPS smooth animation  

If all of these pass ‚Üí **Perfect!** üéâ
