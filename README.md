# CLI Audio Visualizer

A beautiful, cross-platform audio visualizer for your terminal, written in Python. Features multiple visualization modes, colorful output, and excellent compatibility with PulseAudio (Linux), WASAPI (Windows), and CoreAudio (macOS).

![Demo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/1a1a1a/00ff00?text=CLI+Audio+Visualizer+Demo)

## Features

- 🎵 **Real-time audio visualization** from your system's microphone or audio input
- 🌈 **Multiple visualization modes**: bars, waveform, spectrum analyzer, dots, and blocks
- 🎨 **Colorful terminal output** with intensity-based color coding
- ⚡ **Cross-platform compatibility**: Linux (PulseAudio), Windows (WASAPI), macOS (CoreAudio)
- 🔄 **Easy mode switching** with spacebar
- 💾 **Configuration persistence** - remembers your last used visualization
- 🎛️ **Smooth animations** with configurable refresh rate and smoothing

## Installation

### From PyPI (coming soon)
```bash
pip install cli-audio-visualizer
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimonBaars/cli-audio-visualizer.git
cd cli-audio-visualizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

### System Dependencies

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
# For PulseAudio support
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils python3-dev portaudio19-dev

# For development headers
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio-dev
```

#### Linux (Fedora/RedHat)
```bash
# For PulseAudio support
sudo dnf install pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils python3-devel portaudio-devel
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install portaudio
```

#### Windows
No additional system dependencies required - uses WASAPI by default.

## Usage

### Command Line
After installation, run:
```bash
audio-visualizer
```

Or if installed from source:
```bash
python -m audio_visualizer.main
```

### Controls
- **SPACE**: Cycle through visualization modes
- **Q** or **ESC**: Quit the application

### Visualization Modes

1. **Bars** - Classic frequency bars visualization
2. **Waveform** - Time-domain waveform display
3. **Spectrum** - Frequency spectrum analyzer with color-coded frequency bands
4. **Dots** - Dot matrix pattern based on frequency and time
5. **Blocks** - Block-style visualization with variable block heights

## Configuration

The visualizer automatically saves your preferences in `~/.cli-audio-visualizer/config.json`:

```json
{
  "last_visualization": "bars",
  "colors": true,
  "sensitivity": 1.0,
  "smoothing": 0.5,
  "fps": 30
}
```

## Audio Input Setup

### Linux with PulseAudio
The visualizer works best with PulseAudio and will automatically detect and use PulseAudio devices. To monitor system audio output:

```bash
# Create a monitor source for your speakers
pactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1

# List audio sources
pactl list sources short

# Set default input to monitor your speakers
pactl set-default-source alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor
```

### Windows
The visualizer uses WASAPI by default. Make sure your microphone is set as the default recording device in Windows Sound settings.

### macOS
Uses CoreAudio by default. Ensure your microphone is enabled in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Microphone.

## Troubleshooting

### No Audio Input Detected
1. Check that your microphone is working and set as default input device
2. Verify audio permissions are granted to terminal applications
3. On Linux, ensure PulseAudio is running: `systemctl --user status pulseaudio`

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce refresh rate by modifying the config file
2. Close other audio applications that might be using the input device
3. Try a different visualization mode (some are more computationally intensive)

### Installation Issues
1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed
2. Install system audio dependencies before Python packages
3. On Linux, you may need to install additional development packages

## Development

### Setup Development Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimonBaars/cli-audio-visualizer.git
cd cli-audio-visualizer
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
