19f62a9 fix: Remove debug logging from bars visualizer
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Debug Logging (19f62a9)
- Removed debug counter and print statements from bars visualizer
- Clean, production-ready code

### 2. Full Screen Visualization (efb4c2c)
- Removed header text (title, mode, color scheme)
- Removed footer text (controls)
- Full screen for visualization only
- Use entire terminal height and width

### 3. Fixed Bar Distribution (789e832)
**Issue:** More bars at end than beginning
**Fix:**
- Changed from `max()` to `mean()` for better distribution
- Reduced power curve from 0.7 to 0.5
- More balanced appearance across frequency spectrum

### 4. Made SPECTRUM Distinct (c1e61f0)
**Issue:** BARS and SPECTRUM looked identical
**Fix:**
- SPECTRUM now uses thin bars (│) with gaps between them
- Half width bars (every other column)
- Professional audio equipment look
- Slower peak decay (0.008 instead of 0.01)
- Peak indicator uses ─ instead of ▬

### 5. Smoothed WAVEFORM (d3ac34a)
**Issue:** Too jumpy/chaotic, needed continuous line
**Fix:**
- Increased smoothing from 0.6 to 0.85 for calmer animation
- Draws vertical lines (│) connecting adjacent points
- Continuous appearance instead of dots
- Custom smoothing in state for better control

### 6. Completely Redesigned LEVELS (f1ccab3)
**Issue:** Old design wasn't good
**New design:**
- 3 large VU meters for key frequency ranges:
  - **BASS**: 20-250 Hz
  - **MID**: 250-2000 Hz  
  - **TREBLE**: 2000-20000 Hz
- Thick horizontal bars (3 rows high)
- Labels on left, percentage on right
- Filled: solid █ blocks, empty: ─ lines
- Smooth 0.7/0.3 smoothing
- Direct FFT processing

## Test It

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python visualizer.py
```

**Controls:**
- `SPACE` - Cycle modes (6 modes)
- `ENTER` - Cycle color schemes (6 schemes)
- `Q` - Quit

## Visual Differences Now

1. **BARS**: Thick solid vertical bars (█), full width
2. **SPECTRUM**: Thin vertical bars (│) with gaps, peaks with ─
3. **WAVEFORM**: Smooth continuous line oscilloscope
4. **MIRROR_CIRCULAR**: Symmetric bars from center
5. **CIRCULAR_WAVE**: Solid circle with waveform modulation
6. **LEVELS**: 3 large horizontal VU meters with labels

All modes now visually distinct!
