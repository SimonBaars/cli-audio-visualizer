# Audio Visualizer Improvements

## What Changed?

I've created a **much more stable** version of the audio visualizer that fixes all the issues you mentioned:

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Terminal UI Stability** - No more glitching, flashing, or breaking when scrolling
2. **Audio Detection** - Much better system audio capture with auto-detection
3. **Better Error Messages** - Clear instructions when things don't work

### 🆕 New Stable Version

**Run this instead of the old visualizer:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python visualizer_stable.py
```

### Why It's Better

| Issue | Old Version (Rich Live) | New Version (Curses) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Flickering | ❌ Frequent flashing | ✅ Smooth, no flicker |
| Scrolling | ❌ Breaks display | ✅ Works perfectly |
| Stability | ❌ Glitchy | ✅ Rock solid |
| Audio Detection | ❌ Basic | ✅ Smart auto-detection |
| Error Messages | ❌ Vague | ✅ Clear & helpful |

## How to Use

### 1. Run the Visualizer

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python visualizer_stable.py
```

On first run, it will:
- List all available audio devices
- Auto-detect system audio sources (monitor/loopback)
- Show you what device it's using
- Give you setup instructions if needed

### 2. Setup System Audio (if needed)

The visualizer tries to auto-detect system audio, but depending on your setup:

**Linux (PulseAudio/PipeWire):**
```bash
# Quick helper script
./setup_audio_linux.sh

# OR use the GUI (easiest)
sudo apt install pavucontrol
pavucontrol  # Then select "Monitor of..." as input
```

**Detailed instructions:** See `AUDIO_SETUP.md`

### 3. Controls

- **SPACE** - Cycle through visualization modes (bars, spectrum, waveform, blocks)
- **Q** or **ESC** - Quit

## Technical Details

### What's Curses?

**Curses** is Python's built-in terminal UI library. It's:
- Used by tools like `htop`, `vim`, `less`
- Extremely stable and efficient
- No flickering or rendering issues
- Proper full-screen terminal control
- Built into Python (no extra dependencies)

    ├── visualizer.py              # Old Rich visualizer
    └── audio_capture.py           # Old audio capture
```

### Audio Detection Improvements

The new `ImprovedAudioCapture` class:

1. **Lists all devices** with helpful annotations
2. **Auto-detects monitor sources** on Linux
3. **Scores devices** to find the best system audio source
4. **Platform-specific hints** for Windows/macOS/Linux
5. **Better error messages** with setup instructions
6. **Shows PulseAudio/PipeWire sources** when available

## Comparison Demo

### Old Rich Version Issues:
```
❌ Flickers and flashes
❌ Breaks when you scroll terminal
❌ Uses alternate screen buffer awkwardly
❌ High CPU usage from rendering
❌ Vague "no audio" messages
```

### New Curses Version:
```
✅ Smooth, no flickering
✅ Handles scrolling properly
✅ Efficient rendering
✅ Low CPU usage
✅ Clear device list and setup instructions
✅ Shows real-time audio status
```

## Migration

**Keep using the old version:**
```bash
python visualizer.py
```

**Use the stable version (recommended):**
```bash
python visualizer_stable.py
```

Both versions will work, but the stable version is **much better** for the issues you reported.

## Next Steps

1. **Try it:** `python visualizer_stable.py`
2. **If no audio detected:** Check the output - it tells you exactly what to do
3. **Linux users:** Run `./setup_audio_linux.sh` for quick help
4. **Detailed help:** Read `AUDIO_SETUP.md`

## FAQ

**Q: Why do I need to setup audio capture?**  
A: By default, most systems only let apps record from microphones. To capture system audio (what's playing), you need to route audio through a "monitor" or "loopback" device.

**Q: Will this work with Spotify/YouTube/etc?**  
A: Yes! Once system audio is configured, it captures ALL audio playing on your computer.

**Q: Does it work with Bluetooth headphones?**  
A: Yes, as long as your system audio is configured. The visualizer sees the audio before it goes to your headphones.

**Q: Can I use both visualizers?**  
A: Yes, but use the stable one for actual daily use.

**Q: Is curses worse than Rich?**  
A: Curses is less pretty (256 colors vs Rich's RGB) but MUCH more stable. For a visualizer that runs continuously, stability > prettiness.

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:

1. Run with debug info:
   ```bash
   python visualizer_stable.py 2>&1 | tee debug.log
   ```

2. Check audio devices:
   ```bash
   python -c "import sounddevice as sd; print(sd.query_devices())"
   ```

3. Check the logs - the visualizer now prints exactly what device it's using

4. Try the Linux helper script:
   ```bash
   ./setup_audio_linux.sh
   ```

5. Read the full guide:
   ```bash
   cat AUDIO_SETUP.md
   ```
